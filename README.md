# Simulation of 8088-8086-processor
This project shows a basic working of 8088-8086 processor.


WORKING:



To achieve this basic working and simulation of 8088-8086 processor we designed functions in Python capable of showing the generated op code for various commands like MOV,XOR,ADD, in command line. These processors convert every command passed to them into specific machine codes which only computers can understand and execute the desired task. Our program works on this same principle where we take a command as input from the user and convert it into a unique specific op code by some defined rules. All the possible cases were handles in our codes for example in MOV instruction we dealt with register-memory,memory-register,register-register,register-immediate,memory-immediate as well as displacemnet cases for memory. In order to use the project one can simply use the code run it and pass some instruction the result of which would be displayed as a unique opcode.
